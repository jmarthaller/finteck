# Finteck

A site to aggregate predictive data to forecast the likelihood of human-shark interaction off the coast of California's most popular beaches.

Data includes:

- Shark sightings pulled from online alert systems
- General migration trends for various shark species by season
- Mapped paths of currently geo-tagged sharks
- Oceanic swell and wind data (and how that correlates to shark movement)
